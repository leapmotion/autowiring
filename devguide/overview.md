Autowiring IoC Framework    {#mainpage}
=========================

Autowiring is an [inversion-of-control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control) framework for C++11. It provides a declarative way to manage resources through [dependency injection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection). Instead of explicitly instantiating dependencies, simply declare what you need and Autowiring will manage object creation and wiring.

Autowiring provides the following services:

* Injects dependencies
* Manages object lifespan
* Manages thread lifespan
* Manages event broadcast and reception
* Manages [filter graph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_graph) packet creation and delivery

# Organization

A Context is a basic unit of organization in an autowired application. A Context defines the scope in which autowiring resolves dependencies, broadcasts events and filter graph packets, and maintains object and thread lifespans. Contexts form a tree structure. The root of the tree is the global context, which is created automatically. Contexts can "contain" other contexts as child nodes in the context tree. Dependencies within a child context can be satisfied by an autowired member of a parent context (if it can't be satisfied within the child itself).

Most applications will only have a few contexts. Child contexts are most useful when managing temporary resources. For example, if you have multiple views to the same data, the data model could be a type within a parent context while each view exists within a child context. These child contexts could be created and destroyed on demand.

# Autowiring

Inside a context, objects can be autowired directly or as members of another autowired object. Only one instance of an autowired type can exist in a context. Once a autowired type is added to a context, it exists until the context is destroyed.

\include snippets/Context_Overview.txt

This example creates a context and autowires two members into it. Type Foo contains its own AutoRequired member, so an instance of Bar is also created. When a member of type Bar is added to the context directly, it receives a shared pointer to the existing instance of Bar. Thus bar and foo.bar reference the same instance.

Autowiring "slots" can also be injected into a context without creating a new instance of the injected type. Autowired slots are filled immediately, if possible, otherwise, they are filled as soon as a matching type is created.

\include snippets/Context_Overview_Autowire.txt

In this case, the bar member of the Foo instance is Autowired instead of AutoRequired. Thus the shared pointer remains unset until the instance of Bar is created. 

# Filter graph networks

Autofilters support the creation of filter graph networks within a context. Autowired objects within a context can implement the Autofilter function, which will be automatically invoked when a suitable packet is dispatched by the AutoPacketFactory or another filter.

 The publishing object does not need any knowledge of the receiving objects. Similarly, the AutoFired event system allows an object to define a callback function that gets called whenever an event is triggered.
