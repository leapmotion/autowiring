# Purpose

Autowiring is an [inversion-of-control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control) framework for C++11. It provides a declarative way to manage resources through [dependency injection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection). Instead of explicitly instantiating dependencies, simply declare what you need and Autowiring will manage object creation and wiring.

# Build [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/leapmotion/autowiring.png)](https://travis-ci.org/leapmotion/autowiring)

Autowiring project structure is specified with [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/). Simply point CMake to the root project directory and generate your desired project file. While Autowiring is written using C++11 features, it supports linking the non-C++11 STL. The `C++11/` directory provides [boost](http://www.boost.org/) shims for missing C++11 library features.

### Mac

Mac dependencies are installed with [port](http://guide.macports.org/) or [brew](http://brew.sh/).  If you have port installed, this will build the project:

    git clone git@github.com:leapmotion/autowiring.git
    cd autowiring
    sudo port install boost cmake
    cmake .
    make
    make test
    sudo make install

### Unix

The commands for Unix are different depending on what package manager you're using.  Ubuntu's package manager is apt-get, OpenSUSE uses zypper, and
CentOS systems use yum.  The major apparent difference to the user will be that the package to install has a different name.  For Ubuntu, do this:

    git clone git@github.com:leapmotion/autowiring.git
    cd autowiring
    sudo apt-get install libboost-dev cmake
    cmake .
    make
    make test
    sudo make install

### Windows

Unfortunately, Windows doesn't have any sort of nifty package manager, and this requires that you download and install the boost dependency by hand.  Once
you've followed the instructions for installing boost as indicated [here](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_55_0/doc/html/bbv2/installation.html) you will
need to set BOOST_ROOT during cmake configuration time to point to the path where boost was built.  Here's the magic incantation required, assuming you're
running from a MinGW terminal (comes for free with [Git Extensions](https://code.google.com/p/gitextensions/).  You're also going to need a copy of Visual
Studio 2012 or better.  Other build systems will probably work, but they aren't officially supported here.

    git clone git@github.com:leapmotion/autowiring.git
    cd autowiring
    cmake . -DBOOST_ROOT:Path=<path/to/boost/with/forward/slashes>

At this point, you'll have a solution file in your root directory called "Autowiring.sln", if you run Visual Studio as an adminstrator and build the INSTALL
target then Autowiring will be installed on your system.  As with the other platforms, CMake will be able to find autowiring when it's installed this way
via the [find_package](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/command/find_package.html) command.

# Install

Autowiring uses CPack, which knows how to use rpm/deb/wix/dragndrop, and will target the correct version depending on which system you're on.  To build
the installer on Windows, you must first download the [wix toolset](http://wixtoolset.org/).  Other CMake installations on the current system will be able
to find Autowiring once the package is installed by this means.

Generally speaking, there is not really much reason to build an installer yourself unless you're testing out the bleeding edge.  The
[releases page](https://github.com/leapmotion/autowiring/releases) lists the officially supported Autowiring releases.
