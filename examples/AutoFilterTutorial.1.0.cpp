/// @page AutoFilterTutorial_1_0 AutoFilter Tutorial 1.0
/// This tutorial will introduce the reader to the different kinds of `AutoFilter` input parameter semantics.
///
/// The central theme to the Autowiring implementation of the `AutoFilter` concept is that parameters are only
/// distinguished by their types, modulo the type semantics of `AutoFilter` parameters, and that there can only
/// be at most one instance of a type in the execution of a filter network at any given time (with certain caveats
/// which will be explained later).
///
/// Regarding distinguishing `AutoFilter` input parameter types, for a given C++ type `T`, there are several related types
/// which are considered equivalent in the at-most-one-instance sense described above.  They are:
/// - `T`
/// - `const T`
/// - `const T &`
/// - `std::shared_ptr<const T>`
/// - `const std::shared_ptr<const T>`
/// - `const std::shared_ptr<const T> &`
///
/// @code{.cpp}
#include <autowiring/Autowired.h> // Needed for Autowiring classes.
#include <iostream>               // Needed for std::cout.
#include <string>                 // Needed for std::string.
#include <unordered_set>          // Needed for std::unordered_set.
/// @endcode
/// We will now define several structures having AutoFilter methods.  Note that classes and structs are essentially equivalent
/// in C++ (besides the default access specifiers), so using struct here doesn't indicate anything special, it just allows us
/// to avoid having to explicitly write the `public:` access specifier.
///
/// For each type in the list above, we define a struct having an AutoFilter having that parameter type.  The method will print
/// a reflective message indicating the struct and the type, and then store the input value.  The input values that we will
/// send will indicate the type used to decorate the packet used in the execution.  This way, we can verify that the expected
/// inputs were received by the expected context members.
