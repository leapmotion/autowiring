///<summary>
///This class implements the atomic_object interface to a shared reference.
///This will enable the construction of unlock_objects that combine the existential
///guarantee of a shared_ptr with the immutability guarantee of a lock_guard.
///</summary>
///<remarks>
///This class guarantees the existence of a referenced atomic_object.
///In order for shared_object to be thread-safe the reference is defined on construction.
///Defining assignment to apply to the referenced object instead of the reference
///ensures that the behavior of a shared_object is identical to an atomic_object,
///since the referenced object cannot be changed.
