/// <summary>
/// Implements an exception filter type, invoked when an unhandled exception is thrown
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// An exception filter is called with an exception current in the application, and it
/// can access this exception either with current_exception or via throw.
///
/// Implementors of this interface must use throw or std::rethrow_exception in order to
/// filter the passed exception.  Generally, the filtration technique should be written
/// as follows:
///
/// try {
///   throw;
/// } catch(custom_type_1& t1) {
///   ...handling code...
/// } catch(custom_type_2& t2) {
///   ...handling code...
/// }
///
/// Alternatively, this strategy may be used:
///
/// try {
///   throw;
/// } catch(custom_type_1&) {
/// } catch(custom_type_2&) {
/// }
/// ...handling code...
///
/// Filtration methods may safely allow any unhandled rethrows to percolate to the caller.
///
/// Unhandled exceptions thrown in a context will cause that context to be torn down.  By
/// the time the exception filter is called, teardown of the context originating the
/// exception is inevitable.  The originating context may potentially be torn down already
/// by the time the filter method is called.
///
/// All filter methods are guaranteed to be called in the thread and context of the code
/// which threw the exception.  In the case of Fire, it will be in the context of the
/// caller.  In the case of Defer, it will be in the context of the callee.
/// </remarks>

  /// behavior.  If this behavior is not desirable, greater care should be taken to
