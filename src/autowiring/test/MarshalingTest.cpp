/*
EXTRA SPECS to code to that have not yet been implemented as unit tests.

1. Sender and Client each import the same header file which defines a UUID event.
2. Sender encodes UUID of its event in the serialized stream
3. Client reads UUID and args, and reverse-look ups the correct memfn to call the memfn
4. Client gracefully handles receiving UUID events it can't reverse lookup
5. EVERYONE should know when you change ANY identifying properties of a DECLARE_UUID
you must change the UUID as well or you will get version incompatilibity erros.
Extra points for figuring out how to enforce this.

Other Goals:
Broader SFINAE: force server and client to define their own Autoserialize or Autodeserialized
If the types aren't POD. At the very least, tests need to be written which violate the 
"I can do everything with stringstreams" implementation currently passing
